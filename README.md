# STA326 - Assignment 3

## Overview

This assignment focuses on implementing and comparing three recommender system models—GMF, MLP, and NeuMF—based on the Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) framework as discussed in the referenced paper by He et al. (2017). The implementation will utilize the MovieLens dataset and will be evaluated using HR@10 and NDCG@10 metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- PyTorch 1.8 or later
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib


## Models

- **GMF (Generalized Matrix Factorization)**: A matrix factorization model enhanced with neural architecture.
- **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)**: A deep learning model for learning user-item interaction functions.
- **NeuMF (Neural Matrix Factorization)**: Combines GMF and MLP under a shared framework for enhanced performance.

## Usage

To run the models, first configure the `MODEL` in `config.py`, which should be one of `["ml-1m_MLP", "ml-1m_GMF", "ml-1m_Neu_MF"]`. 
If `MODEL == "ml-1m_MLP" `, you should further configure the `MLP_LAYER`, which should be an integer between `0` and `4`. 
After configuration, run:
```
python main.py
```

This script will train the specified model on the MovieLens dataset and output the evaluation metrics HR@10 and NDCG@10.

## Evaluation

After training, the models' performance can be evaluated by comparing HR@10 and NDCG@10 metrics. Additionally, you can reproduce the ablation study for the MLP model with different layers to observe the impact on performance.
